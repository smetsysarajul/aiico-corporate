          <p class="paragraph">AIICO commenced operations in Nigeria in 1963 as an Agency office of American Life Insurance Company (“ALICO”) – at the time, a subsidiary of American International Group (“AIG”). The Company was incorporated, registered and licensed in Nigeria as American Life Insurance Company Limited – as a wholly owned subsidiary of ALICO/AIG – in 1970 – to offer Life and Pension products and insurance services. The Company was renamed American International Insurance Company Limited (“AIICO”) upon the acquisition of a 60% stake by the Federal Government of Nigeria, and later listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange in 1990, after which both shareholders – the Federal Government of Nigeria and AIG divested.</p>
