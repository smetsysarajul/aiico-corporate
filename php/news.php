                    With an average contribution of 24%, agriculture has remained a significant contributor to Nigeria’s
                    GDP. Being the provider of employment for over 60% of the population, agriculture is pivotal to
                    economic development, and more of the efforts to revive the economy, and reduce significantly the
                    level of poverty, should be devoted to energizing the agricultural sector.
