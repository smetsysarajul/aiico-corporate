				      <p class="paragraph">
				        Annuity is a long-term investment that is issued by an insurance company like AIICO and is designed to help protect you from the risk of outliving your income. Through annuitization, your purchase payments (what you contribute) are converted into periodic payments that can last for life.
				      </p>
				      <p class="paragraph">
				        An annuity plan from AIICO Insurance policy provides offers flexible plans to contribute into the fund that are also tax deductible and retirement earnings to suite your preference.
				      </p>
				      <p class="paragraph">

				            This plan encourages self-discipline by saving for the rainy day. You can determine your earning at retirement and fund it effectively. There is a death benefit of a multiple of 5 times annual earnings when he becomes an annuitant.

				          <p class="paragraph text-secondary">
				            Immediate annuity also includes the option for a spouse to continue receiving 75% of your annuity benefit after the annuitant’s demise.
